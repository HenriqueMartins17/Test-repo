Six types of view are available in APITable.Grid view:  A view is suitable for directly and intuitively adding, editing, displaying a large amount of information at the same time.Album view: A view consists of small cards with highlighting the images of records.Board view: A view is ideal for showcasing task progress, making project management and task assignment more easier.Gantt: A view of horizontal timeline showing the task sequence and duration and helping manage overall projects.Calendar: A clear view of all schedules in a month, providing teams and individuals with a visual calendar planner.Architecture view: A view showing the hierarchy information. By dragging the cards, you can structure the information and build a delicate description of a enterprise organization.Dashboard and widgets\\u200bA dashboard is a new file type that acts like a container, allowing data to be extended with more capabilities by using various widgets.No code, simply drag and drop, your data can be visualized.Users\\' roles and permissions\\u200bAfter creating a space, you are the master administrator of the space and have unrestricted permissions in the space.You can friends or team members to work together in your space, and assign them as sub-administrators to give certain specific permissions.
