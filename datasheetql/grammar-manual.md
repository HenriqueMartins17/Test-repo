## Lexical Rules

- All keywords are case insensitive, but table names, field names, and view names are case sensitive.
- The rules of identifiers (including table names, field names, etc.):
  - Starts with a letter (Unicode letter) or an underscore, followed by zero or more letters, digits, or underscores. (also Unicode ones)
  - An identifier can be surrounded by curly brackets, such as `{ü•∞ „è¥}`.  
    If written in this form, an identifier can contain non-letter and digit characters, such as emojis or spaces.  
    If the identifier contains curly brackets, escape it with a `\`, e.g. `{{A\}}` represents the identifier `{A}`.  
    If the identifier contains backslashes, also escape it with a `\`, e.g. `{1\\2}` represents the identifier `1\2`.
- String literals are surrounded by doute quotes, e.g. `"abc"`.  
  Escape sequences:
  - `\\` represents `\`.
  - `\n` represents newline.
  - `\"` represents double quote.
- A line comment starts with `--` (two dashes) and continues until the end of the same line.

## Create a Table

Create a single table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> ( <field list> ) <table modifier>
```

Creating multiple tables simultaneously (Tables can link to each other):

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> ( <field list> ) <table modifier> AND TABLE <table name> ( <field list> ) ...
```

- `<table modifier>` is optional.
- `<field list>` is a sequence of one or more _field declarations_, separated by commas.
- Field names in a table must be unique.
- If the primary key of a table is not the first field, it will be moved to the first column.
- A table must have **exactly one** primary key.
- The field list can be followed by the modifier `PRIMARY KEY <field name>` to specify the primary key, e.g.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example1 ( field1 TEXT, field2 NUMBER, PRIMARY KEY field1 )
  ```
- When creating multiple tables simultaneously, all `TABLE` keywords before the table names can be omitted, except the first one, e.g.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example1 ( field1 CURRENCY PRIMARY KEY ) AND example2 ( field1 TEXT )
  ```

### Table modifiers

#### Comment

Syntax:

```sql
COMMENT <comment expression>
```

where `<comment expression>` is a [constant expression](#Constant%20Expression), whose result must be a string and will be used as the description of the table.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
  field1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY
) COMMENT "This is table1";
```

### Field Declaration

Syntax:

```sql
<field name> <field type> <field modifier list>
```

where `<field modifier list>` is a sequence of zero or more *field modifier*s, separated by spaces.

Example:

```sql
field1 CURRENCY UNIT "$/kg"
```

#### Field Modifiers

##### Primary Key

Syntax:

```sql
PRIMARY KEY
```

where `KEY` can be omitted.  
A table must have **exactly one** primary key.

Field types that can be used as a primary key: single line text, multiline text, number, currency, percentage, datetime, URL, phone number, E-mail, formula, and auto increment number.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
  field1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY
);
```

##### Comment

Syntax:

```sql
COMMENT <comment expression>
```

where `<comment expression>` is a [constant expression](#Constant%20Expression), whose result must be a string and will be used as the description of the field.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
  field1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY
);
```

##### Default Value

Syntax:

```sql
DEFAULT <default value expression>
```

where `<default value expression>` is a [constant expression](#Constant%20Expression), whose result must matches the type of the field.

Field types that allow default values: single line text, choice, number, currency, percentage.

Multiple default items is not supported for multiple choice field currently.

If the field is of datetime type, a special default value `AUTO` can be specified, meaning the current timestamp will be filled into the field when a record is newly created.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table1 (
  field1 TEXT DEFAULT ("foo" & "bar"),
  field2 DATETIME DEFAULT AUTO
);
```

#### Field Types

##### Single Line Text

Syntax:

```sql
TEXT
```

##### Multiline Text

Syntax:

```sql
LONG TEXT
```

or

```sql
MULTILINE TEXT
```

or

```sql
MULTI LINE TEXT
```

##### Choice

Single choice:

```sql
CHOICE <choice modifier list>
```

Multiple choices:

```sql
MULTI CHOICE <choice modifier list>
```

where `<choice modifier list>` is a sequence of zero or more *choice field modifier*s, separated by spaces.

**Choice modifier**:

- `( <item list> )`: Item list is a sequence of zero or more choice items, separated by commas. Each item is a [constant expression](#Constant%20Expression) whose result is a string, or an identifier.  
  **Limitation**: Items must be unique, but API Table does not have this limitation.
- `MULTI`: Make this field a multiple choice.  
  This modifier have the same effect as the above `MULTI CHOICE` syntax, so for example `CHOICE (male, female) MULTI` is identical to `MULTI CHOICE (male, female)`.

##### Number

Syntax:

```sql
NUMBER <precision> <number modifier list>
```

where `<precision>` is a constant expression, whose result is a number and one of `1`, `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001` or `0.0001`.  
`<precision>` is optional, the default precision is `1`.

`<number modifier list>` is a sequence of zero or more *number field modifier*s, separated by spaces.

- `PRECISION <precision>`: Same as the above `<precision>` notation.
- `UNIT <unit>`: Specifies the unit of the number„ÄÇ`<unit>` is a constant expression whose result is a string, and currency mnemonics as in [Currency](#Currency) can be used, such as `CNY` and `EUR`. Example: `field1 NUMBER UNIT RMB`
- `SEPARATOR`: Shows thousands separator.

##### Currency

Syntax:

```sql
CURRENCY <precision> <currency modifier list>
```

where `<precision>` is a constant expression, whose result is a number and one of `1`, `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001` or `0.0001`.  
`<precision>` is optional, the default precision is `1`.

`<currency modifier list>` is a sequence of zero or more *currency field modifier*s, separated by spaces.

**Currency modifier**:

- `UNIT <unit>`: Specifies the symbol of the currency„ÄÇ`<unit>` is a constant expression whose result is a string, and _currency mnemonics_ as in the following table can be used.
- `LEFT`: Shows currency symbol at the left side. Exclusive with `RIGHT`.
- `RIGHT`: Shows currency symbol at the right side. Exclusive with `LEFT`.

**Currency mnemonics**:

|    Name    | symbol |
| :--------: | :----: |
| CNY or RMB |   Ôø•   |
|    JPY     |   Ôø•   |
|    USD     |   ÔºÑ   |
|    EUR     |   ‚Ç¨    |
|    GBP     |   Ôø°   |

Currency mnemonics occuring in `<unit>` expressions will be replaced by their corresponding currency symbols, and these mnemonics can be used in calculations, e.g. the result of `CNY & "/kg"` is `Ôø•/kg`.

Currency mnemonics are case insensitive, e.g. `cny` is identical to `CNY`.

##### Percentage

Syntax:

```sql
PERCENTAGE <precision> <percentage modifier list>
```

where `<precision>` is a constant expression, whose result is a number and one of `1`, `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001` or `0.0001`.

Time format is optional, is omitted, time is not shown.

**Date format**Ôºö

- `DD`, e.g. `28`

**Time format**:

Example: `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm`, spaces can be added properly to improve readability.

## Expression

Expressions in DatasheetQL play different role in different places, and different restrictions are enforced to different roles.

### Constant Expression

Expressions that are computed at compile time, so no fields can be referenced in the expression.

### Filter Expression

Expressions that are used in the filter condition of lookup fields.

Due to the limitation of Fusion API, this type of expression is not supported currently.
goes from higher to lower

### Formula Expression

Expressions that are used in formula fields. All other fields can be referenced, and all APITable formula functions can be used.

### Operator

Operators in the following table are listed in descending precedence, operators in the same line have the same precedence.
